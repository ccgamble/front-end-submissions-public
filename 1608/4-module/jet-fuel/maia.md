###Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of   
https://github.com/maiastone/jet-fuel/blob/master/app.js#L77-L86   
Why were you proud of this piece of code?      
I found this project extremely challenging, so I just picked a get request I set up as an example of learning    
the new server side content.   

###Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about   
https://github.com/maiastone/jet-fuel/blob/master/public/scripts.js#L31-L56   
Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?   
This file needs major refactoring and looks terribly formatted on github.  Looks better in atom, but clearly needs work.   
I would have broken out functions, axios calls, and on click events into smaller more manageable pieces.   

###Comments
Thanks for working with me through this.  I learned a ton.  I'm now done.
