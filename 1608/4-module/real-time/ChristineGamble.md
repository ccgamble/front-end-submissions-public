## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?
Yes, I believe I met all of the base functionality.
- [x] Can generate a new poll
- [x] Gets back a link that can be shared with others to the poll
- [x] Users need to authenticate themselves before they can vote
- [x] Can see real time poll results and a picture of each student next to their response

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?
No extensions

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[Code](https://github.com/ccgamble/Real-Time/blob/master/public/poll.js#L19-L26)
I think this code is fairly clean and is a good way of hiding/showing the poll based on the login status of the user.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[Code](https://github.com/ccgamble/Real-Time/blob/master/public/styles.css#L1-L7)
This is all of my styling. I know this isn't really included in the project spec, but it would have much better UI/UX if I had time to add SOME styling.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!
I'm still trying to deploy to heroku. I missed that lesson, and I'm currently running into some errors.
