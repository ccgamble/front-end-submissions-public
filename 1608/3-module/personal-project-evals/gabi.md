## Feature Delivery

### 1. Completion

The amount of functionality that was actually put in place was limited, but there was good prioritization of what should be focused on first. Getting the base functionality of adding a new anesthesia reading was a great place to start and can be more easily built upon in future iterations.

### 2. Organization

Made use of github issues, though none of them were ever marked as completed or closed. The pull request we worked on together was easily readable and understandable, and the commits were small and easy to digest.

## Technical Quality

### 1. Test-Driven Development

Testing files were stubbed in, which is always half the battle. Though there wasn't significant code coverage with tests, I would recommend in the future just stubbing out everything you might think you'll want to test. Having a written test file that outlines all of the functionality will make it much easier to go back and flesh out the tests later on.

### 2. Code Quality

There were some misunderstandings around setting up the redux store and integrating data storage with firebase. While there was significant refactoring that could be done, it was demonstrated that there is a solid understanding of how react should interact with redux and the flow of calling actions from components to actions to reducers.

## Product Experience

### 1. User Experience

The app in its current state was understandable and easy to use, though there was little time for styling. Again, I think it was a good job prioritizing the more difficult aspects of functionality because a polished UX means nothing if the app doesn't work. With an extra week of time I think we could polish up the UI and focus on styling what functionality does exist. 

### 2. Performance

The application is acceptable performance-wise, there were no instances where the code could have been written in a more performant way and the responsiveness and load times were fast. There was no significant lag or delay when using the application.
