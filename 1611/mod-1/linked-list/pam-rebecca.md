### Evaluator: Louisa

### Notes:
Well done, need to work on locking in details like indentation consistently. Had a slight lack of balance between both Pam and Becca sharing the JS and CSS writing. Used jQuery and Flexbox, which required some end-of-project refactoring to include. Good job taking risks!

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
