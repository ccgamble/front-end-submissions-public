## Evaluator: Robbie

## Notes:

* Nice work refactoring everything out of the `index.js`
* Need to work more on unit testing functions, there were a good amount of tests written, but need to be tested more
* Canvas and context declarations from the document should not be in any file other than `index.js`, otherwise, you should pass it through the constructor or as function arguments

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

### JavaScript Style

* 3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints
