## Evaluator: Robbie

## Notes:

* Need more testing for game "collisions" before testing can be a 3 or above
* Break out the game logic (check right, check left, ...) into it's own object so it can be tested
* Some good efforts for refactoring, but there is some repeated code
* Hard coding numbers based on canvas dimensions - not good for changing canvas dimensions

### Functional Expectations

* 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

### User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

### Testing

Completed testing and broke out functions to new class after evaluation in order to pass portfolio.

* **3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.**
* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### JavaScript Style

* 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

### Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint showsâ€¦

* 3 - Five or fewer complaints
