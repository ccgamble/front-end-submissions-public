## Evaluator:

## Notes:

* Using vanilla JS, would want to see you comfortable with using jQuery
* A lot of hesitancy with syntax and the WHY behind why you're writing each line of code (should have practice with addEventListener syntax so that it comes to you without looking the the docs)
* Saw you knew the individual components of the problem along the way, but didn't understand the big picture of solving the problem and how to use each component as part of the whole problem
