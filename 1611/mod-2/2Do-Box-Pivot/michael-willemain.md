# Instructor Evaluation Points: 2DoBox
# Instructor: yung-jhun is soft D:
# Comments:
- loved how maintainable the tests were
  - great use of for loops and how -v the tests were
  - keep doing this it's going to set you up for some real success in the future
  - testing is the key to writing good refactorable code.
- Loved the file organization
  - helpers are super great! would love to see that
  - great use of closures and helper functions
  - I would like to see some of the files broken out.
  - turn it into an object and call each function so you can test that inside of a file.

# Specification Adherence

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

# Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations


# HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.


# JavaScript Style

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.


# Utilization of es6

* 4 - Developer has used more than one new es6 feature in their code. Developer should be able to speak to what the feature(s) does/do and why it improves the code for future developers. Developer has zero instances of the es5 style in their code left in the codebase.

# Testing

* 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.


# Workflow


* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
