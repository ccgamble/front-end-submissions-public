# Comments:

- established some really good rhythms
 - I would like to see some of those things teased out just a little more
 - Would like to see functions broken out into smaller pieces early and often

- let the test's guide you! 

# Specification Adherence

* 3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

# Accessibility

* 3.5 - The application has a strong accessibility presence. The developer showed a strong effort to keep accessibility in mind from the beginning of the project. The application has 0-3 aXe-core violations.

# User Interface

* 3.5 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

# HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Utilization of es6

* 2 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable	 	Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times	 	Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.


# Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.


# Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
