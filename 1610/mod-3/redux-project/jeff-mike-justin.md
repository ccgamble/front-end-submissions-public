## Students & Project: Mike, Jeff, Justin, Movie
## Evaluator: Brittany
## Notes: Full spec adherance and put a lot of thought into usability/implementation. Solid effort getting tests in, though it's still a struggle all around for the mod. Redux was well integrated into the React components.

### Specification Adherence  

* 4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

### Redux Architecture

* 4: Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux container components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

### Workflow

* 4: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.
