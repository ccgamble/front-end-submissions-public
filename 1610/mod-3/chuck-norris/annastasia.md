Notes: A bit light on the feature implementation as we ran into some bugs that prevented all the functionality from falling into place.  Good work trying to test the features and components that were in place, and solid effort on design though not 100% polished.

## Specification Adherence

2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 of the features outlined in the specification above.

## Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

## Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
