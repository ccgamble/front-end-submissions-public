Student: Mike Limberg
Notes: Good work on the design spec and was able to get many of the features in, including styling the toggle of the controls setting. Testing was limited but had great questions about how to improve there and had a good understanding of what problems he was facing, which made it easy to discuss next steps for getting past those hurdles. Some areas where code could be refactored to reduce duplication, but overall very solid use of React and easily readable code.
