Notes: Ran into some problems with routing with improper nesting that caused some further problems down the road, but did a great job overcoming those bugs by finding alternative solutions to implement the same functionality. App was in a useable state though didn't 100% match design specs due to improvisation. Was able to persist data to localStorage and added many tests, though they were very tightly tied to the HTML.

## Specification Adherence

4 - The application completes all 3 iterations above and implements one or more of the extensions.

## Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## Design

3 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

## Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
