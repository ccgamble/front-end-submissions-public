Notes: Prioritized getting the functionality in place over the design, which allowed for getting all the features in. Good strategy and use of time on a tight deadline. Some areas where code can be refactored to reduce duplication and improve clarity with better naming conventions, but overall demonstrated a good understanding of react and the design patterns.

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

## Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

## Design

2.5 - Developer made a strong effort to match provided comps, some changes requested by evaluator.

## Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested
