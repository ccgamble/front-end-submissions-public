## Specification Adherence

* 3.5 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Component Architecture

* 4 - Application is broken out into small reusable React components. Complicated functionality is wrapped in parent components. There are zero cases where a complicated component can be broken down into smaller composite components.

## User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## CSS/Sass Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

## Workflow

* 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) showsâ€¦

[Bumped to a 3!]

* 2 - Six to ten complaints

## Design

* 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.
