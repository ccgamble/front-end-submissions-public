# Comments:
 - solid components
 - developers understand where state needs to go
 - would like to see more pure functions and helpers
 - that would also step up your testing game.


## Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

* 3.5 - Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

## User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## CSS/Sass Style

## JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing
