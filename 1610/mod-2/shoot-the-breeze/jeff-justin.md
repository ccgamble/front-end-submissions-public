# Instructor Evaluation Points: shoot-the-breeze
# Instructor: yung-jhun
# Comments:

- Great group interaction
- Opportunities in code to refactor
- Test are great, would like to see more sinon tests
- Tests will improve once the state decoupled. 

## Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Component Architecture

* 3 - Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

## User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

## CSS/Sass Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints

## Design

* 3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.
