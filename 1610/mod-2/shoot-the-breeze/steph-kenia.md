# Instructor Evaluation Points: shoot-the-breeze
# Instructor: yung-jhun 
# Comments:

- The skeleton bones are in place
- would like to see state moved down to other components
- project was incomplete but developers spent time on react

## Specification Adherence

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.

## Component Architecture

* 3 - Application is broken in out into at least 6 components that properly encapsulate functionality. There is no more than one component that could be broken down into composite parts.

## User Interface

* 1 - The application is confusing or difficult to use.

## CSS/Sass Style

* 1: Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of CSS/Sass is doing. Developer writes code with unnecessary selectors or tags which do not increase clarity.

## JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

## Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

* 4 - Zero complaints

## Design

* 1 - Layout, content hierarchy, typography, and color choices actively detract from the userâ€™s ability to use the application.
