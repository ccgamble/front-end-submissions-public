# Comments:

- code has opportunities to refactor
- beef up tests
- some glimpses of great code! would like to see more.
- 3 spec deliverables missing. 

# Specification Adherence

<!-- * 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

* 2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above. -->

* 1 - The application is missing * 3 or more smaller features or 1 major feature essential to having a complete application.

<!-- 0 - The application is unusable. -->

# Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations


# HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.


# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Utilization of es6

* 2 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable	 	Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times	 	Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.

# Testing

<!-- * 4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

* 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.

* 2 - Project has sporadic use of tests. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested. -->

* 1 - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

# Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
