# Comments:
- code is structured really well
- loved the closures
- could refactor some code using loops and passing in more arguments


# Specification Adherence

* 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.


# Accessibility

* 4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.


# User Interface

* 4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.


# HTML Style

* 4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

# JavaScript Style

* 4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.


# Utilization of es6

* 2 - Developer has used one new es6 feature in their code. Developer cannot effectively speak to why the code change is valuable	 	Developer does not implement the code change more than a few times	 	Developer has mismatching es5 and es6 syntax in files.

# Testing

* 3.5 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. The application makes some use of feature testing.


# Workflow

* 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
