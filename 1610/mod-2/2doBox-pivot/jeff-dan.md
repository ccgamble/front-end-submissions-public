# User Interface

* 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

# HTML Style

# JavaScript Style

* 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

# Utilization of es6

# Testing

Provisional - need one piece broken out and unit tested (DONE!)
