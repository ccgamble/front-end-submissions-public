## Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more features not included in the specification. The application is an exemplar and is considered a production-level MVP (minimum viable product). The application is ready to be distributed to users.


## Risk Taking and Creativity

4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.


## Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.


## User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.


## HTML Style

3.5: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.


## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application. The testing in this project shows that the students dedicated themselves to overcoming obstacles and figure out how to test parts of the application that were otherwise “hard to test.”

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Accessibility

4 - The application demonstrates an exceptional knowledge of web accessibility. The application has no aXe-core violations, is fully functional without using a mouse, and the application uses HTML/CSS to ‘chunk’ content into more manageable pieces. The application utilizes semantic HTML.

## Code Sanitation

4 - Zero complaints
