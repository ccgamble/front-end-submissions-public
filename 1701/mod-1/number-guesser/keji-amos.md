## Evaluator: Bree
## Notes: 

* Work on the alignment and spacing to more closely match the integrity of the original comp
* More markup than you need, should look to refactor
* Refactor the header section with an h1 and a couple of spans 
* Some redundant CSS (check out those inputs)
* Some good breakout of individual functions, but recommend refactoring your checkGuess function. It's a multi-nested if/else. Break it apart and go check out JS case statements.
