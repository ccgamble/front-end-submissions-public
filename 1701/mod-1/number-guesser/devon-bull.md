## Evaluator: Bree
## Notes: 

*  Address alignment issues at the larger screen sizes 
*  Adress colors for enabled/disabled state on buttons
*  Address redundant and overwriting CSS
*  Consider putting back the focus on inputs for accessibility, but you can change the color to match your project palette   
*  See if you can refactor that if/else statement. Check out JS switch statements.
