## Evaluator: Bree
## Notes: 

* Check out JS switch statement for if/else function that is kind of bulky
* Revisit your mobile size media query - open it up a bit for sizes between 320 - 400. Right now, you are essentially optimizing for a 1px range.
* Revisit the font-family properties across your CSS, as it is an inherited property and you probably don't need to repeat it across your code so much.
