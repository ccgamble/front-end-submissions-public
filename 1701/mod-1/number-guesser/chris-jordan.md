## Evaluator: Bree
## Notes: 

* Need to fix the layout for 320 minimum
* Fix alignment in Header and centered game content (header is off-center to the right a bit)
* Fix footer element that is actually your header
* Some redundant and unused CSS 
* Consider alternate approach for refactoring fun with the disabled states of your buttons. So instead of adding/removing class, experiment with turning on/off disabled attribute on the element
* Break up the monolithic functions that are gnarly if/else and nested if/else conditionals
