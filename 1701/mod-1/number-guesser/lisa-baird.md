## Evaluator: Bree
## Notes: 

* Is not styled for mobile sizes yet, looks good at about 440px and above
* Number font is too thick
* Needs to lose thick grey border bottom on the app (in the comp it is just the browser window, not intended as a border on the app)
* Need to swap the greys so that lighter is the indicator for disabled
* Need to fix the clear disabled state
* Need to throw an error for guess that is outside of range, rather than accept and then deliver message. Consider trying an alert.
* Suggested to use CSS convention in class names with all lower case, and hypens for compound class names. Not kabob case.  
* Could refactor CSS to be more consistent/idiomatic
* JS is looking cleaner and much improved. Suggested refactor is to re-write sans the global variables.
* Lisa will address the 2.5's and turn in assignment by Friday for re-grade.

### UX/UI Expectations

- 2.5: Application meets the basic spirit of the comp but overlooks many details. Extensions show questionable design decisions that negatively impact the overall UX/UI.

### Functional Expectations

- 2.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

### Fundamental HTML

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax
