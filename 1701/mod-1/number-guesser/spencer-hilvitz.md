## Evaluator: Bree
## Notes: 

* Watch the formatting in html, don't need so many line breaks
* Some redundancy, remember fonts are inherited properties
* JS - overall looking good, however should shore up the event listener code for the guess button. Use one addListener to call the various functions you want to run.
