## Notes:

### UX/UI Expectations

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations

- 2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

### Fundamental HTML

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

### Fundamental CSS

- 2.5:  Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 2.5: Application runs but the code is confusing with unnecessary or poorly named variables, functions, and unclear organization, structure, and/or duplication
